      "question": "What is the MSF AI Assistant and how does it protect privacy?",
      "answer": "The MSF AI Assistant is an internal AI chatbot developed for MSF staff. It uses Microsoft Azure's Open AI large language models while keeping all data within MSF, ensuring privacy and control. Using ai.msf.org is a safer and more secure environment than using other external free AI tools, which offer very little privacy guarantees.",
