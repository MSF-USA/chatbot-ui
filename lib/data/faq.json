The AI Assistant can help with answering questions, generating content, translating text, brainstorming ideas, and more.

      "answer": "Quick Actions let you quickly apply prompts and tones to your messages:\n\n• Prompts: Reusable templates for common tasks (e.g., 'Translate to French', 'Summarize this document'). Create custom prompts or use the built-in AI assistant to generate them.\n\n• Tones: Adjust how the AI responds (e.g., Professional, Casual, Technical).

    {
      "question": "What is Search Mode?",
      "answer": "Search Mode enables web search when the AI needs current information. There are two options:\n\n• Privacy-Focused Mode (default): Only sends search queries to Azure AI Foundry, not your full conversation. More private but slower.\n\n• Azure AI Foundry Mode (GPT-4.1 only): Stores your full conversation in Azure AI Foundry for faster responses with direct web search access.\n\nLearn more about the privacy differences in Settings > Models > Search Routing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I use voice transcription?",
      "answer": "Click the microphone icon in the chat input to start recording. The AI will transcribe your speech to text. After transcription, you can:\n- Copy the text\n- Download as a file\n- Translate to 13+ languages (Arabic, Bengali, English, French, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Ukrainian, Urdu, and more)\n\nThis feature is great for meeting notes, interviews, or quick voice input."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the MSF AI Assistant on my phone?",

Tap 'Add to Home Screen' (iOS Safari) or 'Install' (Android Chrome)\n3. The app will work like a native app with offline support and faster loading\n\nYou can also install it on desktop browsers for a better experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where is my conversation data stored?",
      "answer": "Your conversation history is stored locally in your browser's storage, not on any server. This means:\n- Your chats only exist on your device\n- They won't sync across devices or browsers\n- Clearing browser data will delete your conversations\n\nIf using Azure AI Foundry Mode for search, only those conversations are also stored in Azure AI Foundry with a thread ID. See Settings > Models for more details."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Custom Agents?",

Find them in Settings > Models > Agents tab."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I trust the AI's responses 100%?",
      "answer": "No. While the MSF AI Assistant is a powerful tool, it should not replace human judgment and expertise. Always:\n- Verify factual information\n- Check for bias and accuracy\n- Review outputs before using them in official work\n- Do not enter personal data or highly sensitive information\n\nThe AI is an assistant, not a decision-maker."
    },
