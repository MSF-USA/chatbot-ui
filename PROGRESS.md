## üìä Current Status

**Overall Progress**: ~75% complete

- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation - 100% complete
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Service Layer - 100% complete
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: UI Components - 100% complete
- ‚úÖ Phase 4: App Router - 100% complete
- üìã Phase 5: API Routes - 0% complete (can stay as Pages Router for now)

### Files Created This Session
- **20 service/store/hook files** in `lib/`
- **28 new component files** in `components/`
- **7 App Router files** in `app/`
- **1 middleware file**
- **Total: 56 new TypeScript files**

### Files Deleted
- `pages/api/home/home.tsx` (576 lines)
- `pages/api/home/home.context.tsx`
- `pages/api/home/home.state.tsx`

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Testing** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Write unit tests for Zustand stores
   - Write tests for service functions
   - Component tests for new components
   - E2E tests for critical flows

2. **Polish & Bug Fixes**
   - Test migration flow with real data
   - Fix any TypeScript errors
   - Test all features work end-to-end
   - Ensure old components still work during transition

3. **Optional Improvements**
   - Fully refactor ChatInput (currently delegates)
   - Add direct conversation links: `app/(chat)/c/[conversationId]/page.tsx`
   - Migrate API routes to App Router (Phase 5)
   - Add more comprehensive error boundaries

4. **Deployment**
   - Update deployment config
   - Test in staging environment
   - Gradual rollout to production

---

## üìù Notes

### Architecture Improvements
- **No more massive contexts**: Replaced single 34-field context with 4 focused Zustand stores
- **Type safety**: All services and stores fully typed with TypeScript strict mode
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear layers (stores ‚Üí hooks ‚Üí components)
- **Testability**: Services are pure functions, easy to test
- **Performance**: Selective subscriptions with Zustand (no unnecessary re-renders)

### Breaking Changes
- Completely new state management (Zustand instead of Context)
- New localStorage format (versioned, will require migration)
- Different component architecture (composition over monoliths)

### Migration Strategy
- `localStorageService.migrateFromLegacy()` handles old data format
- Migration banner will prompt users on first load
- Export/import functionality for backup
