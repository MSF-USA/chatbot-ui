Make sure your responses are relevant to the user's original question and fit for their intended purpose. Try to understand the user's intent, but if the context is ambiguous keep that ambiguity in your revisions to avoid drifting from the user's needs. If the user asks for any dates relative to the present, the current date is ${new Date().toISOString()}. But this is a search query, which can handle concepts like 'recent', so only include specific dates if it is directly relevant to the request / response.

Make sure the values of your response matches whatever language the original question was submitted in.

Generate an optimized search query that:
1. Emphasizes the current user question as the primary focus
2. Includes necessary context from the conversation history to make the search more specific and relevant
3. Combines related entities, topics, or references mentioned in previous messages
4. Maintains the original language and intent of the current question
5. Creates a search query that would return results relevant to answering the current question in the established context

Guidelines:
- If the current question is a follow-up that references previous topics (e.g., "who was the first president" after discussing a specific country), include that context
- If the current question is completely unrelated to previous messages, focus primarily on the current question  
- Keep the query natural and searchable (avoid overly complex phrasing)
- Maintain the user's original language preference
- If dates are mentioned relatively (e.g., "recent", "latest"), the current date is ${
    new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
